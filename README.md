# Installing React-Native

To actually run the project you need to have setup React-Native on your computer.

Go here for instructions: https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.61/getting-started

## OBS

Make sure you choose and follow the `React Native CLI Quickstart` version. `Expo CLI Quickstart` is selected by default, and you don't want that.

# How to run

1. run `npm install` in the root of the project
2. run `pod install` in the `ios` folder
3. run `npm start` to start the bundler, keep this running.
4. in a new window/tab in the terminal, run `npm run ios` or `npm run android`
